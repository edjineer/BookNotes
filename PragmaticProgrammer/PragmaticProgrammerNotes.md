## 1. A Pragmatic Philosophy

* Pragmatic Programmer = aware of the bigger picture, make intelligent comprimises and informed decisions
  * Take responsibility in everything they do
* The Cat Ate my Source Code
  * "The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak"-JB Bousset
  * You have the right not to take on a responsibility for an impossible situation or where the risks are too great.
  * By accepting responsibility for an outcome, you're held accountable for it.
  * Its up to the programmer to provide solutions, not excuses.
  * **T3 Provide Options, Don't make lame excuses**
* Software Economy
  * **T4 Don't live with broken windows**
  * Broken window theory: broken window = small things lead to bigger problems
* Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs
  * Soldiers were catalyst to bring the group together
  * "Start up fatigue" = guarding resources
  * People find it easier to join a an ongoing success
  * **T5: be a catalyst for change**
  * Gentle and gradual deception
  * **T6: Remember the big picture**
  * Take time to look around to view the bigger picture before it's too late (frog soup)
* Good Enough Software
  * Software is often better in shorter incubation
  * Involve users in the trade off process
  * **T7: Make Quality a Requirements Issue**
  * Rough edges today can be better than waiting a year with nothing good in the meantime
  * Know When to stop: from an artists perspective
* Your Knowledge Portfolio
  * Knowledge is an expring asset: it gets out of date quickly
  * Invest in your knowledge regularly, diversify it, manage risk (dont put all your eggs in one basket), rebalance regularly (the industry changes rapidly)
  * **T8: Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio**
  * Pg 15 has recommendations on staying current
  * When you can't answer a question, find someone who can, and learn from them
  * **T9: Critically Analyze what you read and hear**
  * "Care and cultivation of gurus" = man a lot of this is easier now with Chat GPT, but you HAVE to apply the critical thinking lense to it
* Communicate
  * "A good idea is an orphan without effective communication"
  * Ideas for effective communication
    * Know what to say
    * Know your audience
    * Choose your moment
    * Choose a style (just the facts)
    * Make it look good
    * Involve your audience
    * Be a listener
    * Get back to people
    * **T10: Its both what you say and the way you say it**
